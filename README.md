# Hi :3

I'm a 16-year old audio-nerdy transgirl. You can find all of my projects here, most of which are VST plugins. I have four years of audio experience and about five years of development experience. Currently I'm learning about DSP and working with digital audio, specifically using the JUCE framework. If you have a website that hosts free VST plugins, feel free to add mine. Just make sure to add a link to my GitHub.
