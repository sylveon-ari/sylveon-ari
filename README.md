# Hi :3

I'm a 16-year old audio-nerdy transgirl. You can find all of my projects here, most of which are VST plugins. I have four years of audio experience and about five years of development experience. Currently I'm learning DSP and working with digital audio, specifically using the JUCE framework. If you have a website that hosts free VST plugins, feel free to add mine. Just make sure to add a link to my GitHub.
